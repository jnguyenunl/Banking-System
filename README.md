## Information
The website should be launched from the Index.cshtml file found in Views/Home since that is our main home page. As we were unable to launch our database and our project using Azure, our tables are dropped everytime the project is run. When the database is opened and connected in Visual Studio before the preview is launched, the project is unable to be ran. If you are to open the database connection before running the program, Visual Studio may have to be closed and re-opened if it does not initially work.
